Once you've coded your home page (and it displays the way you want and error free) then it's time to start creating other pages for the site. Since the home page is a "jumping" point to other content, it would be good to reuse as many elements and styles that we can from it.

Elements we can reuse are:

The container/wrapper that centers the site in the browser
The Header (Which has a name or logo)
Main Navigation
The Footer
Start with making a copy of the index.html and rename it a page you're going to have in the site. You can now delete and modify the content areas of the framework to the new page's content topic. You can even add divs and other elements and add styles in the CSS.

 

Directions:

For this week we are going to build the:

Bio page (bio.html)
Events page (events.html)
Issue (issues.html)
Video Page (video.html)
Contact (contact.html)
All these pages should be accessible from the home page navigation!

Populate content for the pages:

Bio
