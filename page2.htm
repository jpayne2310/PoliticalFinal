<p>Originally a resident of The Underworld, Grim is an 'Undead, talking, magical skeleton', along with the rest of his family: 
So far, Grim has been identified as having a father (named "Earl" in passing), a mother, (also only named in passing as "Miriam"), 
a grandmother known simply as "Granny-Grim", and a Great Aunt called "Aunt Kali", (named for the Hindi Goddess of the same name).  
Grim's mother has been heard speaking with a Jamaican accent like Grim does, along with Granny-Grim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">Grim attended Doomsday Junior High School with other supernatural entities, such as Eris, Nergal, 
Lord Pain, and Boogey. Grim was unfortunate enough to be stuck as the favorite target of the school bully, Boogey, who enjoyed 
making the lives of the other students (Grim in particular) as miserable as possible. Grim played Underworld Little League as a 
child, and was also a member of the 'Dead Poets Club' during junior high. But, thanks to Boogie's antics, Grim was labeled with
 the nickname of "Wedgie Shakespeare" for the rest of school. </p>
