<p><div class="p3">Jobs will be Grim’s highest priority. If elected, Grim will combat this issue from an angle no one 
has even thought about before.  The core of the unemployment problem isn’t that there is not enough jobs; the core problem is 
that there is just too many people to fill the jobs that become available.  One of Grim’s first acts in office will be to create 
a scarcity of qualified people for companies to choose from.  He guarantees a permeant end to the unemployment problem.</p></div>

<p><div class="p3">Grim played Underworld Little League as a child.  He knows a thing or two of what baseball can mean 
to a city.  Up until now, both sides of the Pawsox issue, have been unable to come to terms with keeping the minor league team 
in Rhode Island.  If elected, Grim will have a closed door meeting with both sides.  Grim can be pretty convincing when he needs  
to be.  By the end of the meeting, everyone involved will want a new stadium along with moving the team to Providence.  They will 
be motivated as if their lives depended on it.  Grim just has a way of helping people to see the light on certain issues.  </p></div>
